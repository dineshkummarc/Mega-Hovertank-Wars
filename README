This zip file should include 19 files and 2 directories.

To run the game:
1) unzip this archive to the root web directory of your server.
2) run dbSetup.sql (probably best through phpMyAdmin) to setup the database
3) open up /classes/dbConnect.php so you can edit the database settings (server, username, and password)
4) open up /server.php and change lines 13 and 14 to reflect the IP and port you wish to run the socket server on
5) open up /client.php and change line 54 to reflect what you put in /server.php
6) run /server.php and /socketpolicy.pl, probably with the following commands
	php htdocs/server.php
	perl htdocs/socketpolicy.pl
7) browse to http://yourserver/browse.php with three other friends (on three other computers)

This does require the use of a browser that supports the HTML5 canvas element, Flash, and WebGL, which, at this point, is Firefox 3.7a Minefield

The server requires PHP5 with socket extension and Perl installed as well as socket support by the server itself

Unit tests must be run with this client and server-side environment, or they will fail. They can be run by browsing to the .php files in the /tests/
